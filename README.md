# Genetics Evaluation Algorithm

This project was generated with [.NET5](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/).

## Detail
This project is implementation of genetic algorithm that include SUS, Roulette wheel, Tournament and Ranking selection method also we use 1/5 Role and Self adaption for mutation and Simple, Single and Whole recombination.

The project is designed based on the design pattern strategy. which allow us dynamically add any new algorithm to source
## How to run

when you run the project using .NET 5 you will see the form that contain some function that algorithm is try to learn the minimum value for them.
and there is some other options  to set learning config customized. 

the example of runed project is shown below that estimate minimum value with high accuracy.
